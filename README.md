ETF Price Monitoring Service

A Python-based service that monitors the price of an ETF using yfinance and sends notifications via Telegram when certain price conditions are met. The service retrieves both the current price and the highest price over the last 52 weeks with minimal API calls. It runs daily and notifies users when predefined patterns are detected.
